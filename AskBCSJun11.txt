@here is a general example of how to go about establishing an array that stores the users searches in local storage:
To create a dynamic array that grows as the user selects cities and store it in the browser's localStorage, you can follow these steps:
Initialize an empty array to store the city names:
let selectedCities = [];
Whenever the user selects a city, add it to the array:
const cityName = "New York"; // Replace with the actual city name
selectedCities.push(cityName);
Store the updated array in the localStorage:
localStorage.setItem('selectedCities', JSON.stringify(selectedCities));
Retrieve the array from localStorage when needed:
const storedCities = localStorage.getItem('selectedCities');
const selectedCities = JSON.parse(storedCities) || [];
Note: The JSON.stringify method converts the array to a string representation, and JSON.parse converts the stored string back into an array.
To add flexibility, you can encapsulate the array operations in functions:
function addCity(cityName) {
  selectedCities.push(cityName);
  localStorage.setItem('selectedCities', JSON.stringify(selectedCities));
}

function getSelectedCities() {
  const storedCities = localStorage.getItem('selectedCities');
  return JSON.parse(storedCities) || [];
}
Now, whenever the user selects a city, you can call the addCity function with the selected city name, and to retrieve the selected cities, call the getSelectedCities function.
NOTE: Copy/pasting wont really get you anywhere and you will need to match the syntax and variables with what you have/will have in your own code ok?

I will need to close the question soon since we have gone over a couple of different questions during this session, but like I suggested: I would schedule a tutoring session if you need any assistance with how the application should be functioning ok?
Your instructional staff would also be able to offer more insight into the acceptance criteria and the general flow of the application.
